# Automated Accessibility (a11y)

This is an example repository detailing how to automate a11y and add unit testing for it as well.

## Why should I use this?

- reduce cognitive load (TODO: add reference source) by automating
- have fewer bugs opened
- set standards that all devs can easily follow and thus reduce code complexity

## Setup Instructions

TODO: add instructions

- add github action ([see example files](./.github/workflows/))
  - see the [official plugin docs](https://github.com/treosh/lighthouse-ci-action) for more info
- add configuration for plugin ([see example file](./lighthouserc.json))

## Notes on how to use this repository

Note that all of these projects are simply instantiated with defaults and little to no work has been done on them. You should use the test files as a _general_ guide, but note that they are minimal examples. You can contact anyone on the Neo team for assistance if you have questions.
