## Why should I use this?

- reduce cognitive load (TODO: add reference source) by automating
- have fewer bugs opened
- set standards that all devs can easily follow and thus reduce code complexity

## Setup Instructions

TODO: add instructions

## Notes on how to use this repository

Note that all of these projects are simply instantiated with defaults and little to no work has been done on them. You should use the test files as a _general_ guide, but note that they are minimal examples. You can contact anyone on the Neo team for assistance if you have questions.
